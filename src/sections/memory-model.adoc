** `regionMatches(boolean, int, String, int, int)`

====
Function compares two substring.

* What does first argument does?
* What's the difference between 2nd and 3rd integer?
** `boolean` is case sensitivity
** 2nd is offset of other string
** 3rd is length

== !

* `java.sql.Statement`
** `execute(String)`
** `executeBatch()`
** `executeQuery(String)`
** `executeUpdate(String)`

====
At the same time we have nicely crafted `Statement` API

Now compare those two together. Which seem easier to use?

[NOTE.speaker]

Proposed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin

* Sensor memory *miliseconds, loads of things*
* Short term memmory *20seconds, until the next distractions, 7 plus/minus 2 things*
* Longterm memory *learning starts*
** Requires learning
** Rehears
* *Memory / disks example*
