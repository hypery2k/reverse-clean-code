What's wrong with this code

* Very very bad, leaky abstraction over SQL
** You've seen it in you code.. note one
* No single responsibility
** requires modifications to extend with additional functionality

=== We can do it better

[source, java]
----
abstract public class Sql {
   public Sql(String table, Column[] columns);
   abstract public String generate();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public class CreateSql extends Sql {
   public CreateSql(String table, Column[] columns);
   @Override public String generate();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public class SelectSql extends Sql {
   public SelectSql(String table, Column[] columns);
   @Override public String generate();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public class InsertSql extends Sql {
   public InsertSql(String table, Column[] columns);
   @Override public String generate();
   private String valuesList(Object[] fields, final Column[] columns);
}

How these to differ when we see them

* First is commit (or better - ask mate to commit) and run
* Second actually tells us where to make changes

=== Psychology WAT?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
Let me explain
====


=== Affordance

[quote]
a *quality* of an *object*, which *allows* an individual *to perform an action*. For example, a knob affords twisting, and perhaps pushing, while a cord affords pulling

=== Affordance for dummies

image::21-affordance.jpg[background]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* This plate,this knob suggest an action
** These suggestions are called signifiers
====

[%notitle, background-color="white"]
=== Or even simpler

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* We see a box and we build a mental model around that, in our mind.
* Take this box
** We can lift it, shake it, open, look inside, put something inside
====

=== Affordances everywhere

[NOTE.speaker]
====
When done wrong - brings confusion

=== Yedi doors

=== Your Android phone

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Not only among phisical objects, also in IT
** See Android. It's after all fairly easy to bash about
* See this box. It has slider, which suggests an action.
** But at the same time it's a button. WTF??

public class Sql {
   public Sql(String table, Column[] columns);
   public String create();
   public String insert(Object[] fields);
   public String selectAll();
   public String fieldByKey(String keyColumn, String keyValue);
   private String columnList(Column[] columns);

*vs*

[source, java]
----
abstract public class Sql {
   public Sql(String table, Column[] columns);
   abstract public String generate();
}
----

[source, java]
----
public class CreateSql extends Sql {
   public CreateSql(String table, Column[] columns);
   @Override public String generate();

[source, java]

public class SelectSql extends Sql {
   public SelectSql(String table, Column[] columns);
   @Override public String generate();
}

Now take this example

* mental model: what model you build when you see this code
* affordance: what actions does this code allow you to do
* signifiers: what it suggests, what are the next steps

[.take-away]
=== Beware of cargo cult

People will do things in a way, +
because they've always done like that

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* At some point people stop asking why and follow the given path
** Existing pattern
** No matter if it's good or bad
** *Cargo cult*
* Energy conservation
** Brain takes the easiest path, demanding least efforts
* Mimicry in biology
**  antipredator adaptation. Do we have to protect ourselves against anybody at work?

=== But how?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
Whenever I talk about it there are some questions *but how?*

* How not to combine too many concepts in a single class?
* How can you split this monolythic codebase into smaller / workable pieces?
* How to organize your classes to be smaller?
====

=== 'How' itself deserves a separate talk

*On class design*

*On refactoring*


[NOTE.speaker]
====
* but let me share some experience with you
