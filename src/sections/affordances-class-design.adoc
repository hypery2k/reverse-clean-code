* How to structure class code?
* How to organize code into classes?
* How much put into a single class?

a|[%step]
* Does this class hold too much?
* How to split it into chunks?
* How to understand where what belongs?

* What is the right size of the class
* New
** Shall we add this method to a class, does it belong here?
* Existing
** We have a service which is as big as Mount Everest
** We can an utility class which is 8KLOC

Let's start basics.

____
Things that are cohesive (...) naturally stick +
to each other because they are of like kind, +
or because they fit so well together (...) in a mutual relationship.

The pieces (...) seem to be related, they seem to belong together, and it would feel somewhat unnatural (it would result in tight coupling!) to pull them apart

* If we duct tape two things they stick together as well - but that's not relationship we are looking after
* This is all nice, but we need some tools, some (mental frameworks)

* Problem: *class was holding too many concepts*
** What is concept?
** What is too many?
** How me measure it?

* We can analyze manually...

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Split it into concepts
* Separate concepts into packages, domains they belong to
* If it belongs into multiple domains DDD has a concept of Shared Kernel to combine them together
