== Reverse engineering

[quote, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering]
(also called back engineering), is the processes of extracting knowledge or design information from anything man-made and re-producing it or re-producing anything based on the extracted information.

== Clean code

[quote, Stackoverflow, http://stackoverflow.com/a/954626/330070]
Code which reads as close to a human language as possible. I mean it on all the levels: from syntax used, naming convention and alignment all the way to algorithms used, quality of comments and complexity of distribution of code between modules.

== Do I really gonna go like this?

== ... about bad bad code we've all seen

This particular is

* *from* an HR system (custom built)
* *communicating* with project portfolio management system (in house built)
* *via* SOAP webservice communication
** In like 20 different places over various JSP files
** Out of 2600 JSP files in total
** 700k lines of code of JSP files
====

== Oh no!

This is scarry

* With projects like this you could've either:
** run away
** try to work with it - find your way

== Implementation Patterns

[NOTE.speaker]
====
But we have clean code books for the rescue

* Not everybody read it, but we did
* Now we can get a bit bossy
====

== So it's sorted!

== Let's recap what is clean code?

image::https://media.giphy.com/media/gJSJgg6wE32JG/giphy.gif[background]

== Clean code is really about...

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. not doing like this

image::05-comments.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
In essence:

* Not doing like this
====

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. put any meme here

image::05-comments-any.png[]


[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. to feel like this

image::06-comments-woohoo.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Not to feel like this... after a few week

{zwsp}

* we obviously see advantages of clean code, why it works
** it allows us to work better, faster
** communicate more efficently
* Kent has given this different perspective on what was important
** Communication. Simplicity. Flexibility
====

== ... completely different perspective

image::https://media.giphy.com/media/2rqEdFfkMzXmo/giphy.gif[background]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* but through out this session I'll take a different perspective
* we will have a look into some good code and some bad
** and think how our brains works with that
** is there any psychology behind it?

  Yes, we can work together!

I love crossing borders
  Those between IT and any other industry

Yes - I've done UX as well. Of voice recognition and dialogue systems. Eat this ;-)

[NOTE.speaker]
====
OODA Loop - because it's good for everything. And we are agile, don't we

* We will work in a certain order
** example
** problem
** solution
** and some brainiac discussion

== Where does it all go?

== The cognitive limitations

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* We hardly ever look at our code through cognitive capabilities
** Limitations
** Reducing the cognitive load
====

== Psychology WAT?

[%step]
* icon:check-square-o[] {zwsp} Affordances
* icon:check-square-o[] {zwsp} Short term memory
* icon:check-square-o[] {zwsp} Multi-store memory model
* icon:check-square-o[] {zwsp} Nielsen and Krug Heuristics _(from UX)_
* icon:square-o[] {zwsp} {zwsp} Accidental complexity
* icon:square-o[] {zwsp} {zwsp} Attention span
* icon:square-o[] {zwsp} {zwsp} Flow
//* icon:square-o[] {zwsp} {zwsp} SCARF _(Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness)_ model

[NOTE.speaker]
====
Beyond just the clean code

{zwsp}

Nielsen::
* Big mistakes cover the smaller ones
Flow::
* fully immersed
SCRAF::
* more social interaction between team members

== Norman's book

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* So next time when you'll be looking for a book
* Don't rush for another framework
* Take a book from totally different world

== Let's jump back to SOLID

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* This appears to be kind of a baseline
* Still valid, still covered by many
====

[%notitle]
== SOLID

[%step]
* Single responsibility principle
* Open/closed principle
* Liskov substitution principle
* Interface segregation principle
* Dependency inversion principle

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)
* software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.
* many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
* one should “depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
====

* Single responsibility principle
* Open/closed principle
* Liskov substitution principle
* Interface segregation principle
* Dependency inversion principle

[NOTE.speaker]
====
As Dan North recently put it
====

== Why this whole clean code thing, anyway?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Ani nie SOLID
* Jakieś zdroworozsądkowe reguły
* Po co?
** Może jest to odpowiedni komunikat do ludzi na odpowiednim poziomie
** Czasem jest tak że taki mem wchodzi gładko i SOLID dziaramy na przedramieniu
** Czasem lepiej wchodzi jakaś kognitywistyczna podstawa tych zasad
** A czasem dochodzimy po prostu do write simple code
* Może do różnych ludzi te same rzeczy trzeba mówić w różny sposób

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Fajnie jak ktoś to powiedział - ale okazuje się że dla często nie jest to takie oczywiste
====

== There is a model...

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* All models are wrong by some are useful
* Situationa leadership opracowany przez Blanchard'a w latach 70
* Four different leadershit styles
** Telling
** Selling
** Participating
** Delegating

====
* Entuzjastyczny debiutant
** Powiedz co zrobić, pokaż jak zrobić, przećwicz aby się upewnić
* Rozczarowany adapt
** Otwartość na sugestie
* Wątpiący praktyk

** Go and figure out yourself

// [.take-away]
// == 1^st^ Rule of thumb
//
// *Don't make me think*
//
// [NOTE.speaker]
// ====
// * people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things
// * there is enough of thinking in the business domain
// ** *the inherent complexity*
// * don't make it even more complex
// ** let me conserve more energy for the creative problems I have

// [.take-away]
// == 2^nd^ Rule of thumb

// {zwsp}
//
// *A bit of empathy never killed anybody*
//
// [NOTE.speaker]
// ====
// * What you write is of a huge importance to others
// ** to help satisfy human needs - there is human on the other side
// * smaller cost of understanding and analysis upfront
// ** less non-important elements require our immediate attention
