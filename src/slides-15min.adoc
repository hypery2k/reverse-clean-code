[NOTE.speaker]
====
* but through out this session I'll take a different perspective
* we will have a look into some good code and some bad
** and think how our brains works with that
** is there any psychology behind it?

[NOTE.speaker]

In essence:

* Not doing like this

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. put any meme here

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. to feel like this

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Not to feel like this... after a few week

{zwsp}

* we obviously see advantages of clean code, why it works
** it allows us to work better, faster
** communicate more efficently
* Kent has given this different perspective on what was important
** Communication. Simplicity. Flexibility

== Is that all?


== The cognitive limitations

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* We hardly ever look at our code through cognitive capabilities
** Limitations
** Recuding the cognitive load

== Psychology WAT?

Beyond just the clean code

{zwsp}

Nielsen::
* Big mistakes cover the smaller ones
Flow::
* fully immersed
SCRAF::
* more social interaction between team members

* So next time when you'll be looking for a book
* Don't rush for another framework
* Take a book from totally different world

== A Single Rule of thumb

*Don't make me think*

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* people don’t like to puzzle over how to do things
* there is enough of thinking in the business domain
** *the inherent complexity*
* don't make it even more complex
** let me conserve more energy for the creative problems I have

* show intent and make it consumable
