In essence:

* Not doing like this

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. put any meme here

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. to feel like this

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Not to feel like this... after a few week

{zwsp}

* Now we could've go through all (or at least some clean code principles)
* But that would be boring

[NOTE.speaker]
====
Can we make a more scientific approach?

== It's about Psychology!!!

[NOTE.speaker]
====
And about cognition etc

== Psychology WAT?

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* I'll try to show a different perspective on clean code mechanics
* we will have a look into some good code and some bad
** and think how our brains works with that
** is there any psychology behind it?

== Is that all?


== The cognitive limitations

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* We hardly ever look at our code through cognitive capabilities
** Limitations
** Recuding the cognitive load
====

== Psychology WAT?

* So next time when you'll be looking for a book
* Don't rush for another framework
* Take a book from totally different world

== A Single Rule of thumb

*Don't make me think*

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* *show intent and make it consumable*
* people donâ€™t like to puzzle over how to do things
* don't waste others' time on pondering about bad code
* there is enough of thinking in the business domain
** *the inherent complexity*
* don't make it even more complex
** let me conserve more energy for the creative problems I have
