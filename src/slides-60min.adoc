== Reverse engineering

[quote, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering]
(also called back engineering), is the processes of extracting knowledge or design information from anything man-made and re-producing it or re-producing anything based on the extracted information.

== Clean code

[quote, Stackoverflow, http://stackoverflow.com/a/954626/330070]
Code which reads as close to a human language as possible. I mean it on all the levels: from syntax used, naming convention and alignment all the way to algorithms used, quality of comments and complexity of distribution of code between modules.

== Do I really gonna go like this?

====
This particular is

* *from* an HR system (custom built)
* *communicating* with project portfolio management system (in house built)
* *via* SOAP webservice communication
** In like 20 different places over various JSP files
** Out of 2600 JSP files in total
** 700k lines of code of JSP files
====

== Oh no!

This is scarry

* With projects like this you could've either:
** run away
** try to work with it - find your way

== Implementation Patterns

[NOTE.speaker]
====
But we have clean code books for the rescue

* Not everybody read it, but we did
* Now we can get a bit bossy
====

== So it's sorted!

== Let's recap what is clean code?

== Clean code is about...

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. not doing like this

image::05-comments.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
In essence:

* Not doing like this
====

[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. put any meme here

image::05-comments-any.png[]


[%notitle, role="no-shadow"]
== .. to feel like this

image::06-comments-woohoo.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* Not to feel like this... after a few week

{zwsp}

* we obviously see advantages of clean code, why it works
** it allows us to work better, faster
** communicate more efficently
* Kent has given this different perspective on what was important
** Communication. Simplicity. Flexibility
====

== ... completely different perspective

image::https://media.giphy.com/media/2rqEdFfkMzXmo/giphy.gif[background]

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* but through out this session I'll take a different perspective
* we will have a look into some good code and some bad
** and think how our brains works with that
** is there any psychology behind it?

  Yes, we can work together!

Yes - I've done UX as well. Of voice recognition and dialogue systems. Eat this ;-)

OODA Loop - because it's good for everything. And we are agile, don't we

* We will work in a certain order
** example
** problem
** solution
** and some brainiac discussion

== Where does it all go?

== The cognitive limitations

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* We hardly ever look at our code through cognitive capabilities
** Limitations
** Recuding the cognitive load
====

== Psychology WAT?

[NOTE.speaker]

Beyond just the clean code

{zwsp}

Nielsen::
* Big mistakes cover the smaller ones
Flow::
* fully immersed
SCRAF::
* more social interaction between team members

* So next time when you'll be looking for a book
* Don't rush for another framework
* Take a book from totally different world

== 1^st^ Rule of thumb

*Don't make me think*

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* people donâ€™t like to puzzle over how to do things
* there is enough of thinking in the business domain
** *the inherent complexity*
* don't make it even more complex
** let me conserve more energy for the creative problems I have
====

[.take-away]
== 2^nd^ Rule of thumb

{zwsp}

*A bit of empathy never killed anybody*

[NOTE.speaker]
====
* What you write is of a huge importance to others
** to help satisfy human needs - there is human on the other side
* smaller cost of understanding and analysis upfront
** less non-important elements require our immediate attention
